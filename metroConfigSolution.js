The primary cause of these issues is often misconfiguration within `metro.config.js`. For example, incorrect paths, incorrect transformer configurations or missing plugins, especially those related to asset handling or specific module support can cause problems. To resolve these issues carefully review your `metro.config.js` file, ensure all paths are correct and all necessary plugins are installed and properly configured. Consider comparing your configuration with Expo's recommended configuration.  If the problem persists, try cleaning your project cache using `expo start --clear` and reinstalling your dependencies.  Check for conflicting package versions among your dependencies as well.
