This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the `metro` bundler, such as unexpected behavior, build failures, or slow performance.  The root cause can be difficult to pinpoint because it often stems from underlying configuration problems or conflicts with other dependencies.  For example, incorrect configurations in `metro.config.js` or conflicting versions of React Native and Expo packages can trigger such errors.
